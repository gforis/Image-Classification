# CNN-Image-Classification
This is to create a repos for CNN image classifications. It covers 3 use cases. 

One is to build a CNN model to predict cat or dog and data augmentation is used to improved the model.

2nd one is build a CNN model to predict fashion labels using Fashion MNIST dataset.

3rd one is to build a LE-Net model to predict traffic sign images (43 classes). The model is implemented as referred in original publication with model evaluation and model prediction.

4th one is to fine-tune ResNet and InceptionV3 models for covid and Pneumonia detections (4 classes in total). The model is created based on transfer learning with the last 10 layer trainable. Dataset for training is too large to share, but happy to share on demand.
